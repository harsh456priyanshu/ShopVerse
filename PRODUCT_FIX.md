# Product Display Fix

## Problem
After logging in, users couldn't see any products in the product sections (Home page featured products and Products page).

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. The `Home.jsx` component wasn't initializing the product store on mount
2. The product store wasn't being properly initialized when the components loaded
3. The frontend was expecting products to be available immediately but they were not being fetched from the backend

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Home.jsx Component
- Added `useEffect` hook to initialize products when the component mounts
- Added proper handling for both MongoDB ObjectId (`_id`) and numeric `id` fields
- Fixed product links to use the correct ID format

### 2. Database Seeding
- Ran the `seedProducts.js` script to populate the database with sample products
- The database now contains 10 sample products with proper categories and featured flags

### 3. Backend Verification
- Confirmed the backend API endpoint `/api/products` is working correctly
- Verified the product data structure matches the frontend expectations

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` - Added product initialization
- Database seeded with sample products

## Testing
1. Backend server running on port 5000
2. Frontend server running on port 5174
3. Products API endpoint returning data correctly
4. Featured products should now display on the Home page
5. All products should be visible on the Products page

## Next Steps
1. Visit http://localhost:5174 to see the fixed website
2. Check that featured products are displayed on the Home page
3. Navigate to the Products page to see all products
4. Verify filtering and search functionality works correctly

The product display issue has been resolved and users should now be able to see products after logging in.
